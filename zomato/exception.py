#📌**Exceptions**

#Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. In a machine learning pipeline, exceptions can occur 
# at different stages, such as data preprocessing, model training, or model evaluation.

#exec_tb is a traceback object created when an exception occurs.

#tb_frame is an attribute of the traceback object that contains information about the current frame in the call stack at the point where the exception occurred.

#f_code is an attribute of the frame object that contains information about the code being executed in the frame.

#co_filename is an attribute of the code object that contains the name of the file from which the code was loaded.

#The exec_tb variable contains a traceback object, which represents the call stack at the point where the exception was raised. The traceback object contains information about the functions and modules that were called leading up to the exception, as well as the line numbers where the exception occurred.

#In Python, exc_info() is a function from the sys module that returns a tuple representing the current exception. The tuple contains three values: the exception type, the exception value, and the traceback object.

#  If possible, the string returned should be a valid Python expression that can be used to recreate the object.

# and the str() function is called to convert the name to a string.
